# 🤖 Customer Personality Analysis  

## 📝 Overview  
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze customer personalities through **Clustering** and **Classification**. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer data and build an accurate model to predict customer segments.  

---

## 🚀 Project Goals  
### Clustering:  
- Preprocess categorical and numerical data.  
- Achieve a **Silhouette Score** of at least **0.55**.  
- Provide detailed clustering interpretation.  

### Classification:  
- Use the clustering results as labels for supervised learning.  
- Achieve **Accuracy** and **F1-Score** of at least **87%** on both **training** and **testing sets**.
